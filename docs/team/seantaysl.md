## Project: Trackr

__Trackr__ is an application for teaching assistants (TAs) who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their student records. It is uses a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
