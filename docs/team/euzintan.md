## Project: Trackr

### Project Overview
Trackr is an application for teaching assistants (TAs) who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their
student records. It is uses a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still retaining the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). It is written in Java, and currently has over 10kLoC.

### Summary of Contributions

- Code contributed: [tP Code Dashboard]()
- Enhancements implemented:
    - New feature: Created all Tutorial Group related features, including addTG, deleteTG, editTG, findTG and viewStudents.
    - What it does: Allows TAs to add different Tutorial Groups to different Modules
    - Justifications: TAs could be teaching multiple Tutorial Groups across different Modules. This feature helps them
    to keep their Students organised.
    - Highlights: This feature is fundamental to the functionality of Trackr. It was a challenge because its stored in
    the Module class and stores the Student class.
