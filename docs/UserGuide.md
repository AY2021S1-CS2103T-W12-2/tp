## 1. Introduction

Trackr is suited for teaching assistants (TAs) who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their student records. It is optimized for Command Line Interface (CLI), while still retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a TA with a fast typing speed, Trackr is the app for you. Head over to (Section 2, "Quick Start") and get started!

## 2. Quick Start

Get started by installing our app with the following steps:

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest trackr.jar [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to a folder you wish to use as your home folder.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. Shown below is an example with some user commands and the app's responses.

## 3. Features

-   Items in square brackets are optional.
    e.g n/NAME [t/TAG] can be used as n/John Doe t/friend or as n/John Doe.

    e.g. [t/TAG]…  can be used as (i.e. 0 times), t/friend, t/friend t/family etc.
